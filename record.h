 * You may want to define a few different structs to experiment with 
 * how you want to implement certain behaviours
 * Note: You should be certain of the size of your records 
 *       Structs sometimes have padding added so they're easier for the
 *       system to use.
 *       Use the sizeof function if you need to be check the size in bytes
 *       of something.
